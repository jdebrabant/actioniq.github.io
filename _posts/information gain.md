“What we mean by information – the elementary unit of information – is a difference which makes a difference”. (Gregory Bateson, 1972)

During the past few years, the emergence of new technologies in data infrastructure enabled all types of businesses to access, explore, transform and display their web analytics and customer data. It seems that data is the core of any successful business and everyone is on a push to become a data-driven company.. From healthcare services to e-commerce, businesses start to collect their customer data and measure the impact of every change on customer behavior. However, there is a big difference between data and information. Data is the set of raw, unorganized facts, whereas information is a clean, organized and aggregated version of the data that can directly provide some additional insight to a user. Data is for computers. Informations is for humans. The challenge for businesses thus becomes finding the useful pieces of information from a sea of data. 

Data, if used effectively, provides an objective mechanism to evaluate hypotheses about a decision that needs to be made. In information theory, the effectiveness of knowledge is measured by information gain.In simple terms, information gain measures how much knowing a piece of information helps us in making the desired decision, or a measure to understand what makes a difference.  If we let T be the current set of knowledge, or the training set, then we can model information gain, IG,  in terms of information entropy, H,  and additional information, a, using the following: 



The above formula states that information gain is defined by the difference in ‘information entropy’ when not knowing a versus knowing a. In other words, information gain show us the benefit of knowing a. To clarify this,  lets look at a typical business use case. Imagine that we are a hotel trying to figure out how much cleaning staff are needed to clean all of the rooms in the hotel. We have the following objective and hypothesis: 

Objective: Room preparation  time should never exceed 120 minutes after the customer has checked out.

Hypothesis: We have too few cleaning staff to meet our goal. 

To test our hypothesis we have access to rows of data showing the the number of rooms, the staffing size, and the average time of cleaning room. The challenge is to find a data variable which is the best predictor for the truthfulness of our hypothesis. For example, Graph 1A shows the comparison of average time to clean a room with the number of cleaning staff. This graph represents our additional information, a. Unfortunately, the information gain from a is insufficient to test our hypothesis. Thus, in this case, while the data is available, the way the data has been organized into information is insufficient to test our hypothesis. 



In Graph 1B,  we show the same comparison, but this time we break down the average time by hour. This time the report shows us a clue: the number of staff is short during checkout time (between 10am-12pm) but we have more than enough staff from 3pm-7pm. The information gain from 1B allows us to come to the conclusion that the problem was not the number of cleaning staff, but rather their distribution throughout the day. Thus, we can conclude that our original hypothesis was incorrect. In this case, the information gain from 1B was greater than the information gain from 1A.  




When we design products which enable business users to work with data, we should keep in mind that transforming rows and columns of data into different graphical representations is not necessarily useful. In other words,, it is possible to present data in different forms without adding any additional information.  From this, it might seem that picking the best report to test a hypothesis is a task better-suited to the business user. While this is true to some extent, realizing which report contains more information is not obvious and can also depend on the data itself. For example, consider Graph 2A and 2B,  taking the same hypothesis and  data variables from above. In this case, because of a different variance in the data,  there is no difference in the amount of information we can extract from either of the graphs. 

This conclusion has an important impact on how products that present a user with information should be designed. On the one hand, it must consider the hypothesis that is being tested, while on the other it must also consider the data itself. Unfortunately, the information gain from a presentation of data is not known a priori,  so no formulaic approach to such a problem exists. Instead, a product must integrate both the backend information about the data, with the frontend information about the interface, while also providing users the ability to change and adapt the current presentation of data in order to test their current hypothesis. Only by factoring in all three of these variables can a product be flexible enough to present the user with enough information to test a range of hypotheses across an ever-changing set of data.
