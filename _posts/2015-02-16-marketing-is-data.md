In the past few years there has been a revolution in the field of marketing. With the infusion of greater quantity and diversity of data, marketing has begun to transform from an art to a data-driven science. This trend has fundamentally changed how marketers think about, create, and execute campaigns, a change as monumental as the move from print to video-based advertising in the twentieth century. Indeed, it would not be an exaggeration to say that his is the most interesting time to be at the intersection of marketing and technology since the advent of television.

### How Did This Happen?

The primary reason marketing is becoming data-driven is because of trends in consumer behavior and technology evolution. For one, consumers are spending an ever-increasing amount of time on digital technologies, both for entertainment and to make purchasing decisions. Less obviously, these technologies are interconnected, which significantly multiplies the amount of data a single interaction can create. For example, visiting the New York Times homepage generates 26 (!) interactions to third parties (as of late 2014), all of which record or process some data about this seemingly insignificant event. Consumer data in the digital ether is processed, multiplied and accumulated in ways that can lead to powerful insights, but are also increasingly complex.

On the other end, businesses now face complex decisions on how and when to reach a particular consumer. It used to be that direct mail, together with newspaper, radio and TV were the main channels of communication. The modern reality includes new channels ranging from email to mobile (push) notifications to buying online ads to reach a consumer. In addition, each channel has its own complexity, including parameters such as timing, bid dollar amount, and immediate results/feedback. The scale and complexity of the data in each of these decisions has necessitated a move from the human, intuition-based marketing approach to one controlled by innovative new computing technologies.

Finally, the timeframe in which consumer buying decisions are made has been drastically shortened. With the wealth of both quantitative (e.g., product specifications) and qualitative (e.g., consumer reviews) information now available to consumers, decisions that used to take days or weeks can now take minutes. Reacting in such a sort timeframe puts an additional layer of complexity - and opportunity - on top of the process of accurately and intelligently analyzing consumer behavior data.

### Why Do I Care?

The implications of these trends are profound, both from a marketing and a technology perspective. Consider the following:

1. Current marketing strategies are inefficient: Marketing pioneer John Wanamaker famously said, "Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don't know which half." In the era of data-driven decisions, there is no longer an excuse for this excess. Considering that the worldwide advertising market (which only captures a subset of marketing activites) is about $500 billion, there is significant room for improvement.
2. Marketing and data tools are converging: With the influx of greater quantity and complexity of data, traditional marketing tools do not scale; no longer can simple spreadsheets be used to create the necessary reports. At the same time, big data platforms like Hadoop are increasingly used to serve marketing use cases. However, these platforms were not designed for marketing data and workloads, which are unique in many ways. Thus, a new class of purpose-built tools is needed, ones designed for the scale of current and future marketing datasets.
3. Marketers and analysts are converging: A new generation of tools are bringing the two disciplines even closer. By creating platforms designed for marketing, business users will be able to interact with data directly through the use of intuitive interfaces that do not require coding or SQL expertise. This will allow closer collaboration between analysts and marketing professionals, a necessary requirement as both the data and analysis become increasingly complex.

### The Future

The value of human marketing talent is indispensable and will always be a prime source of competitive advantage for a company. However, these highly-skilled marketing professionals will need to be paired with a new generation of purpose-built marketing tools, enhancing their capabilities, not replacing them. Building these tools is not trivial. In fact, the useful information in marketing is hiding in the "long tail" of the data, where each datum alone (e.g., a single mobile app interaction) has almost zero value. However, taken together, all these individual pieces of data can lead to actionable insights that can make or break a business. As a result, the marketing data tools are becoming very advanced and sophisticated.

From a business perspective, the new generation of marketing tools will completely transform the way marketing works. Among other things, they will:

*  blur the line between marketing and data
*  enable marketers to do on their own what today requires an army of computer scientists and statisticians, not to mention a high-cost but general-purpose and ineffective data infrastructure
*  be a tremendous competitive advantage for the early adopters of this new generation of technologies
