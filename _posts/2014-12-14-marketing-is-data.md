# Data = Marketing & Marketing = Data
	
For the past 10 years there has been a revolution in Marketing. This trend has accelerated the past couple of years at breathtaking speed and there are no signs of slowing down. At the core of it, Marketing is becoming a science and art around data. In fact, this is probably the most interesting time to be in the intersection of Markeing and Technology since the invention of the printing press.  

### How Did This Happen?

Marketing is becoming data driven because of trends in consumer behavior and technology evolution. Obviously, consumers are using a lot more digital technologies to spend their time and make purchasing decisions. But at the same time these technologies are interconnected and multiple the amount of data a single interaction can create. For instance, visiting the New York Times homepage generates 26 (!) calls to third parties, all of which record some data about this seemingly insignificant event. This way the consumer data in the web is multiplied, processed and accumulated in ways that make data both very powerful but also very complex. 

On the other end, businesses now have many choices on how and when to reach a particular consumer. It used to be that newspaper, radio and TV were the main three channels of advertisment. But now a business have a range of choices from email, mobile notificiations to buying online ads to reach a consumer. These deicions both generate and require immense amounts of data to be done properly.

Finally, consumer behavior have changed. Buying decisions that used to take days or weeks now take minutes. Reacting in such a sort timefame puts an additional layer of complexity - and opportunity - on top of the accuracy and intelligence of processing use behavior data

### Why Do I Care?

The implications of these trends are profound, both from a marketing and a technology/tools perspective. Consider the following:

1. Marketing pioneer John Wanamaker famously said "Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don't know which half." Guess what - this is not a valid excuse anymore in the data era. Considering that the worldwide advertising market (which only captures a subset of the marketing activites) is about 500 Billion USD, this is a pretty big deal.
2. Marketing and data tools are converging. Data tools like Hadoop are increasingly used to serve Marketing use cases. Marketing tools require increasing sophistication and big data capabilities.
3. Marketers and analysts are converging. A new generation of tools are bringing the two disciplines even closer, by allowing the work of analysts to be leveraged by marketing profssionals and also give more analytical power to the pure business users by providing powerful analytics without requiring coding or SQL expertise.

### The Future

The value of human marketing talent is indispensable and will always be the source of competitive advantage. However, these highly skilled marketing professionals will require to be paired by a new generation of marketing tools. Building these tools is far from being a trivial problem. In fact, the useful information in Marketing is hiding in the long tail of the data, where each datum alone (e.g. a single mobile app interaction) has almost zero value. But taken together all these tiny amounts of information together can make or break a business. This means that the data tools need to be very advanced and sophisticated.

From a business perspective, these tools will completely transform the way marketing works in many ways, including:

*  blurring the lines betweeen marketing and data
*  enabling Marketers to do what today requires an army of Computer Scientists and Statisticians
*  be the source of tremendous competitive advantage for the early adoptors of this new generation of technologies
