  <p>ActionIQ is a stealth startup building the next generation of data-driven business applications. It is based in New York City and funded by top investors including <a href="http://www.sequoiacap.com/">Sequoia Capital</a> and <a href="http://firstmarkcap.com/">First Mark Capital</a>.</p>
  <p>The company is founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tasso">Tasso Argyros</a>, founder and CTO of <a href="http://www.teradata.com/Teradata-Aster/overview/">Aster Data</a>, a Big Data pioneer that was acquired by database leader Teradata; and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitayj">Nitay Joffe</a>, a key developer in leading open source big data projects such as <a href="http://hbase.apache.org/">Apache HBase</a> and <a>Apache Giraph</a> while working at places like Facebook, Powerset and Google. Both Tasso &amp; Nitay have extensive experience applying complex technologies to solve real business challenges.</p>
  <p>At ActionIQ, we are working on a very tall technology stack: we are thinking about web-based responsive UX the one minute and how to minimize CPU cache misses via bytecode generation the other. We like to do everything in-memory. We are using a number of languages, tools and frameworks, including Scala. We love hard systems/performance &amp; algorithmic problems.</p>
