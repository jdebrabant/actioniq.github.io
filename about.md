ActionIQ is a stealth startup building the next generation of data-driven business applications. It is based in New York City and funded by top investors including Sequoia Capital and First Mark Capital.

The company is founded by [Tasso Argyros](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tasso), founder and CTO of [Aster Data](http://www.teradata.com/Teradata-Aster/overview/), a Big Data pioneer that was acquired by database leader Teradata; and [Nitay Joffe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitayj), a key developer in leading open source big data projects such as Apache HBase and Apache Giraph while working at places like Facebook, Powerset and Google. Both Tasso & Nitay have extensive experience applying complex technologies to solve real business challenges.

At ActionIQ, we are working on a very tall technology stack: we are thinking about web-based responsive UX the one minute and how to minimize CPU cache misses via bytecode generation the other. We like to do everything in-memory. We are using a number of languages, tools and frameworks, including Scala. We love hard systems/performance & algorithmic problems.

This is an opportunity to join an ambitious, world-class team in NYC and become part of something truly unique from early on.

We always have room for world-class, exceptional engineers. If your background does not fit our advertised positions but you are excited about our team and vision, feel free to send us a note anyway. 

### We are hiring!
